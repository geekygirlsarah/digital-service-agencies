# Digital Service Agencies

I wanted a list of digital modernization service teams as I've now worked at two and wanted to keep track of more. I also periodically get asked about them, so I wanted to have a list that makes it easy to find and reference!

How would I define a digital service team or a digital modernization group? It's hard, but I'd say a team that's mission is to improve the technology and practices used within it's government space. (There's probably better definitions but this is the simple one in my mind!)

This list is open source and contributions and updates are highly welcome!
